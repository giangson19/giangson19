## Well hello there 👋

I am **Son**, data practitioner, aspiring AI researcher.

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Data Science from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and currently work as an AI research intern at [Continental-NTU Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/continental-ntu). 

My research interests are: *vision-language models (VLM)*, *natural language processing (NLP)* and *large language models (LLM)*.

**Fun facts**:
- 💰 I studied Finance for my bachelor's, but switched career into data before I graduated.
- 🗣️ _"Where are you from? You have an interesting accent."_ or _"Did you study overseas before? Your accent doesn't sound Vietnamese."_ were the most common remarks I heard where I was in Singapore.
- 📖 I've been using English as a first language for since high school (English-specialized class in high school, full English curriculumn in university, then a master's in Singapore). That's probably why I have a strange mixed accent.

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹


My name is **Son** and I am a MSc Data Science student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I am fortunate enough to have been fully sponsored by the [Vingroup Scholarship Program](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/masters-ph-d-scholarship-program/) for my study at NTU.

Concurrently, I am also working as a research intern in AI at [Continental-NTU Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/continental-ntu). I'm supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Shang-wei Lin](https://shangweilin.github.io/) and [Dr. Yon Shin Teo](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Yon_Shin_Teo1). My ongoing research project involves: vision-language models, image captioning, visual question answering.

You can find out more about me at my homepage [giangson19.github.io](https://giangson19.github.io)  or my LinkedIn [linkedin.com/in/nguyengiangson](https://linkedin.com/in/nguyengiangson).

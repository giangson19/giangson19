## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is **Son** and I am a MSc Data Science student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I am honored to receive sponsorship from the [Vingroup Scholarship Program](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/masters-ph-d-scholarship-program/) for my studies at NTU.


Concurrently, I am working as an AI research intern at [Continental-NTU Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/continental-ntu). I'm supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Shang-wei Lin](https://shangweilin.github.io/) and [Dr. Yon Shin Teo](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Yon_Shin_Teo1). My research interests include: natural language processing, large language models and vision-language models.

Previously, I spent [3 years working as a Data Analyst](https://giangson19.github.io/blog/969-days-in-the-life-of-a-data-analyst/) at One Mount Group.

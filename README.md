## Well hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Son** â€” a soon-to-be graduate with a Master's degree in Data Science from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), fully funded by the [Vingroup Scholarship Program](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/graduate-college/admissions/scholarships/vingroup-graduate-scholarship/).

Currently, I am an AI research intern at [Continental-NTU Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/continental-ntu), supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Shang-wei Lin](https://shangweilin.github.io/) and [Dr. Yon Shin Teo](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Yon_Shin_Teo1). My research focuses on **vision-language models for flowchart understanding**, with broader interests in *natural language processing* and *large language models*. <ins>I'm currently seeking research opportunities in these areas and plan to pursue a PhD in the near future.</ins>

Prior to my graduate studies, I was [a Data Analyst with 3 years of experience](./blog/969-days-in-the-life-of-a-data-analyst/) in the tech industry, where I worked on a wide range of business intelligence and applied machine learning tasks.

## Well hello there 👋

I am **Son**, data practitioner, aspiring AI researcher.

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Data Science from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and currently work as an AI research intern at [Continental-NTU Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/continental-ntu). 

My research interests are: *vision-language models (VLM)*, *natural language processing (NLP)* and *large language models (LLM)*.

**Fun facts**:
- 💰 I studied Finance for my bachelor's, but switched career into data before I graduated.
- 🗣️ _"Where are you from? You have an interesting accent."_ or _"Did you study overseas before? Your accent doesn't sound Vietnamese."_ were the most common remarks I heard where I was in Singapore.
  - The answer to that second question was No. But I had been fully educated in English since high school (English-specialized class in high school, and full English curriculum in university).
